Chapter Three Exercises

Analysis Question Set 1:
	1. No, the simulation object asks the environment for a list of al it's objects , so it has a reference to
	   each fish also. That reference still exists after  the environment has removed the fish . This is why 
	   the act method in Fish calls isInEnv.
	
	
	2. The change would advantageous if behavior were added to the act method that depended on  whether or not 
	   the fish had moved. There are no disadvantages other than in the current context the act method would 
	   end up ignoring the return value of a method call.
	
Analysis Question Set 2:
	1. I think I would create separate methods because each has it's own task. Having a method that has them 
	   together would be crowded and  and would be harder to understand.
	
	2. You might easily put the test for empty neighbors in the act method. If the test was false, your code 
	   could bypass both attempting to breed and attempting to move. However the code is more readable and 
	   true to the simulation as it is write.. A fish will first attempt to breed and of the fish doesn't 
	   breed then it attempts to love . Although i do think the the test for when a fish does should have been 
	   placed in the die method because it would make more sense because it would be more consistent with the 
	   program and also easier to understand.
	
	3. Readability is the main advantage . Sometimes when you add a Boolean variable it makes reading the code 
	   more understandable. But there are variables that are unnecessary and may end up increasing the complexity 
	   of the code and make it not as readable. But all of this is a design decision and ends up being how the
