Chapter One Exercises

Exercise Set 1:
1. Complete (yes/no)? yes

2. Yes the fish have the same behavior both times. Even if they start at the same position they move the same each time.
They also don't move backwards or diagonally.

Analysis Question Set 1:
1. The program models the body of water as a two dimensional grid. The lines seem to be seperating different areas or 
locations the fish can swim to.

2. Fish can only move within the boundries of the program or grid and the fish can never be in more than one fish 
in each square.

3. The fish can be facing any direction but it can only be facing on of the walls around the fish dont seem to be 
able to face diagonally. Also the direction of the fish does not seem to matter. But the direction may also 
limit the way the fish can go for its next move depending on it direction or maybe a fish in front of it.

4. It does seem it moves every step, but it could not. It seems that the fish could have an obsticle like another 
fish or boundry that keeps it from moving. When a fish moves it moves exactly one square on the grid. The fish 
don't move backwards it seems they just move straight, left or right.

Exercise Set 2:
1.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1				3x2					straight			yes				forward/up			2x2				straight
	2				2x2					straight 			yes				right				2x3				right
	3				2x3					right				yes				right				2x4				right
	4				2x4					right				yes				down				3x4				down	
	5				3x4					down				yes				down				4x4				down


2. The classmate I compared with had similar results but his started from a different point. The fish doesn't seem to go 
backwards ever through its steps. It goes forward, left and right, but neither I nor the classmate I compared with saw the 
fish go backwards. I am not very confident with the little amount of data this is.

Analysis Question Set 2:
1. Our test results were a little different, along with others in the class. The fish does not seem to have a pattern based 
on the 5 steps of data taken. The 5 steps are not enough data to tell any pattern or anything from the fish.

2.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1				3x2					straight			yes				left				3x1				left
	2				3x1					left				yes				up					2x1				up
	3				2x1					up					yes				left				2x0				left
	4				2x0					left				yes				down				3x0				down	
	5				3x0					down				yes				down				4x0				down		
	6				4x0					down				yes				down				5x0				down	
	7				5x0					down				yes				down				6x0				down
	8				6x0					down				yes				right				6x1				right	
	9				6x1					right				yes				up					5x1				up				
	10				5x1					up 					yes				up					4x1				up
	11				4x1					up					yes				up					3x1				up	
	12				3x1					up					yes				up					2x1				up
	13				2x1					up					yes				left				2x0				left
	14				2x0					left				yes				up					1x0				up				
	15				1x0					up					yes				right				1x1				right
	16				1x1					right				yes				right				1x2				right
	17				1x2					right				yes				down				2x2				down	
	18				2x2					down 				yes				left				2x1				left
	19				2x1					left				yes				down				3x1				down		
	20				3x1					down				yes				right				3x2				right

Analysis Question Set 3:
1. It is a two dimensional grid. 5 across but start at 0 and going to 4 just like an array and then 7 down 
starting at 0 then going to 6. The first number represents the row and the second the column.

Exercise Set 3:
1. Yes it is all as expected
2. Yes it is. I changed the dimensions of the grid to one smaller on the row and column 
and then made the fish start one over
